    <ol>
        <li><strong>Commitment to Accessibility</strong></li>
        <p>
            Supreme Empire, the operator of the "Streets Award" app ("we," "us," or "our"), is committed to ensuring that our app is accessible to individuals with disabilities. We strive to make our app inclusive and provide a seamless experience for all users.
        </p>

        <li><strong>Standards and Guidelines</strong></li>
        <p>
            We aim to meet or exceed the standards set by accessibility guidelines, including but not limited to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. These guidelines are developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and are widely recognized as the benchmark for web accessibility.
        </p>

        <li><strong>Accessibility Features</strong></li>
        <p>
            Our efforts to enhance accessibility include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Screen Reader Compatibility:</strong> We design and develop our app to be compatible with screen readers, allowing users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with the content.</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> The app supports keyboard navigation, ensuring that users who rely on keyboard input can access all functionalities.</li>
            <li><strong>Text Alternatives:</strong> We provide text alternatives for non-text content, ensuring that users with visual impairments can understand and interact with the information.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> We strive to maintain sufficient color contrast to facilitate readability for users with visual impairments.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Ongoing Improvement</strong></li>
        <p>
            We are committed to continually improving the accessibility of our app. Feedback from users is welcome and will be used to enhance the user experience for all.
        </p>
