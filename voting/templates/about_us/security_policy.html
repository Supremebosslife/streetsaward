    <h1>Security Policy</h1>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
        <p>
            We have put several features in place as our commitment to maintaining the security and confidentiality of user data on the Streets Award app. This Security Policy outlines the measures we have in place to protect the information entrusted to us.

                <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Server logs are regularly monitored for suspicious activities, and we have mechanisms in place to promptly respond to security incidents.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
